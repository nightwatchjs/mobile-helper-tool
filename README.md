# @nightwatch/mobile-helper

Official Nightwatch tool to help easily setup all the requirements needed to get started with mobile testing in [Nightwatch.js](https://nightwatchjs.org). Nightwatch.js supports web and native app testing in both Android and iOS devices.

**BONUS:** For Android folks, there's much more this tool has to offer now apart for setting up requirements for testing:

* Setup fully functional Android Emulator environment in a matter of minutes (without downloading Android Studio).
* Alternatively, setup just `adb` to only connect to real devices.
* Easy-to-use CLI flows for common use-cases like connecting to emulator/real devices, downloading new system-images, creating/deleting AVDs, installing/uninstalling apps, and much more.
* For use-cases not covered above, run commands with major Android SDK tools like `adb`, `emualator`, `sdkmanager`, `avdmanager` directly from a single CLI.
* Update your SDK tools automatically and seamlessly (WIP).

## Do more with Android

### Setup Android SDKs

You can now setup a fully functional Android Emulator environment, or just `adb` for connecting to real device, without the need to download the whole Android Studio IDE.

Run the below command to download all the required Android SDKs needed to get the Android Emulator setup and running with Android v11:

```sh
npx @nightwatch/mobile-helper android --standalone
```

The above command makes sure that you have everything you need to use Android Emulator as well as connect your computer to real Android devices.

### CLI Flows for common use-cases

This tool allows you to do a lot of things with simple and tailored flows, accessible through the following subcommands:

1. [connect](./docs/subcommands/connect.md)
2. [list](./docs/subcommands/list.md)
3. [install](./docs/subcommands/install.md)
4. [uninstall](./docs/subcommands/uninstall.md)

| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| --device   | Show a list of all the connected real devices and AVDs |
| --avd      | Show a list of all the currently installed AVDs        |

#### 3. install

This subcommand allows you to install a new system-image, create a new AVD or install an app to a target AVD/device.

```sh
npx @nightwatch/mobile-helper android install [flags]

### Run Android SDK tool commands

Run commands with major Android SDK tools/binaries directly from a single CLI without the need to locate and then run the binaries manually.

**Syntax**

```sh
npx @nightwatch/mobile-helper android.<binary_name> [args]
```

Currently supported binaries: `adb`, `avdmanager`, `sdkmanager` and `emulator`.

Check the following docs to know more about the usage of the above mentioned binaries:

* [Installing Android application](./docs/install-android-application-from-apk.md)
* [Using emulator from CLI](./docs/use-emulator-from-command-line.md)
